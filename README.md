## ⚙️ How It Works (High Level)

1. Team and player data are stored in a JavaScript object.
2. Players are **shuffled** for variety on each reload.
3. A dropdown allows filtering players by position.
4. Cards are dynamically rendered into the DOM.
5. CSS Grid & Flexbox handle layout and responsiveness.

## 🖼️ Preview & Responsive Design

This application is built with a **mobile-first, responsive design** approach to ensure a smooth and consistent user experience across devices.  
By combining **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes without sacrificing readability or usability.

### 💻 Desktop View
![Desktop UI](images/UI-desktop.png)

On larger screens, player cards are displayed in a **two-column grid**, allowing users to view more content at a glance while keeping the interface clean and balanced.

### 📱 Mobile View
![Mobile UI](images/UI-mobile.png)

On smaller screens, the layout automatically adjusts by:
- Switching to a **single-column card layout**
- Stacking team statistics vertically
- Reducing padding and spacing for **touch-friendly interaction**

This ensures the app remains intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
